Executive summary:
The site will be delivered to comply fully with the compatibility and accessibility standards recommended as standard by the Government Data Service at this date.

Client technology compatibility:
In keeping with our generally conservative and broadly-compatible approach, the website will fully support* the latest versions** of following clients

Windows	
- Edge
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

macOS
- Safari 
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

iOS	
- Safari
- Google Chrome

Android
- Google Chrome
- Samsung Internet

* 'fully support' means that all functionality is available with no compromise of user experience or visual quality. In limited cases, the service may offer additional  progressive enhancements to non-essential functionality for users whose systems support it.
** 'latest versionsâ€™ refers to the latest stable version at time of release, as well as the version immediately before that

In line with best practice a planned degrade cascade will support older configurations to the greatest extent feasible.

Accessibility is a core value and best practice will inform design and technical choices throughout the whole development process. 

The site will meet or exceed level AA of the WCAG 2.2 success criteria(2). Although services are presently monitored by GDS only to WCAG 2.1, the extended 2.2 standard is due to be adopted in October so this represents a future-facing approach to the project lifetime as well as our commitment to excellence in this area (3).
