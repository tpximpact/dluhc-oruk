# Open Referral UK

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e1b1ed31-6b28-4473-835a-f99717561741/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/openreferraluk/deploys)

View the latest build of the `main` branch at [https://openreferraluk.netlify.app](https://openreferraluk.netlify.app)

Creating a PR against `main` will also trigger build and deployment of a preview. These are linked from the PR page and Netlify admin panel, but are deployed at https://[BRANCH NAME]--openreferraluk.netlify.app . For example a (fictional) branch `foo` would preview at https://foo--openreferraluk.netlify.app .
